## Overview
This repository contains program that can be used for solving the 2D cutting stock problem using 
genetic algorithms. The project uses the GAlib library to implement algorithms and data structures 
related to genetic algorithms (like crossover and mutation).

## Requirements
 * C++ compiler (must support C++14 standard)
 * GAlib library ([link](http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/))
 * CMake

## Repository structure
This repository contains following directories:
 * `project` - contains source code of the main program and helper scripts
    * `cutting_stock_problem_solver` - main program source code
    * `input` - sample input
    * `scripts` - contains helper Python script that draws the result 
 * `report` - contains project description (in polish)
